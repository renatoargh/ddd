# Domain-driven Design Quotes

> The most significant complexity of many applications is not technical. It is in the domain itself, the activity or business of the user. When this domain complexity is not handled in the design, it won't matter that the infrastructural technology is well conceived. A successful design must systematically deal with this central aspect of the software.

> Domain-driven design is both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated domains. To accomplish that goal, this book presents an extensive set of design practices, techniques, and principles.

Two premises: 1- development is interative and, 2- developers and domain experts have a close relationship

> Extreme Programming recognizes the importance of design decisions, but it strongly resists upfront design. Instead, it puts an admirable effort into communication and improving the project's ability to change course rapidly. With that ability to react, developers can use the "simplest thing that could work" at any stage of a project and then continuously refactor, making many small design improvements, ultimately arriving at a design that fits the customer's true needs.

>  Although fear of unanticipated requirements often leads to overengineering, the attempt to avoid overengineering can develop into another fear: a fear of doing any deep design thinking at all.

> Valuable models do not emerge immediately; they require a deep understanding of the domain. That understanding comes from diving in, implementing an initial design based on a probably naive model, and then transforming it again and again.

## Putting the domain model to work

> A domain model is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey. It is not just the knowledge in a domain expert's head; it is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction of that knowledge. A diagram can represent and communicate a model, as can carefully written code, as can an English sentence.

> The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user.
