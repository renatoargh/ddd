# Domain-driven Design

> The most significant complexity of many applications is not technical. It is in the domain itself, the activity or business of the user. When this domain complexity is not handled in the design, it won't matter that the infrastructural technology is well conceived. A successful design must systematically deal with this central aspect of the software.

> Domain-driven design is both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated domains. To accomplish that goal, this book presents an extensive set of design practices, techniques, and principles.
